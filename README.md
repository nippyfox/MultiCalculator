# MultiCalculator

*v. 0.2*

**The MultiCalculator app** is an advanced version of a calculator with gesture control and selection of required operators for Android, written in Kotlin.

**The app is in beta**, so if there are any problems write me and bugs will be fixed as soon as possible!

## Features

- Tap the calculation result field to reset the calculator.
- Swipe your finger as if you were crossing out an incorrect character and the calculator will erase it. 
- Select the operators you need from the list to work with only what you really need!
